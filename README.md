# **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design**  

This repository showcases real-world mini-projects applying core **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** concepts, including **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **modularity**, and **hierarchy**. Each project demonstrates how OOAD principles can be used to model and solve complex problems effectively.

## **Projects Overview**  

1. **Bank Account System**  
   - Models a fully encapsulated bank account system with features like deposits, withdrawals, and account management.  

2. **IoT Model**  
   - Implements abstraction and modularity to simulate an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for connected devices.  

3. **Non-Encapsulated Banking System**  
   - Demonstrates the drawbacks of lacking encapsulation and how OOAD principles improve design.  

4. **Non-Encapsulated Store System**  
   - Highlights the inefficiencies of non-encapsulated systems and provides insights into better design approaches.  

5. **Project Management System**  
   - Applies hierarchy, modularity, and encapsulation to manage projects, tasks, and team members.

## **How to Use**  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-oriented-analysis-and-design.git
   cd object-oriented-analysis-and-design
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd bank-account-system
   ```  

3. Run the project using your preferred language environment. For example, in Python:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **Key Concepts Demonstrated**  

- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on relevant details.  
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting data and ensuring controlled access through defined interfaces.  
- **Modularity**: Structuring code into manageable and reusable components.  
- **Hierarchy**: Using inheritance and composition to organize relationships between objects.
